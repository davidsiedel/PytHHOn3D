# SHAPES
- Implement the function returning the centroid of a polyhedron
# QUADRATURE
- Implement quadrature on quadrangles, hexahedra and prisms
- Fix quadraure of the tetrahedron
# TESTS
- compare the HHO solution to the L2-projection for a sinus poisson problem
- bad results for HHO(3,3) and HDG (3,4) on mesh_15 -> quadrature order 4/8 ??? tests are OK though
- bad results for HHO(3,3) and HDG (3,4) on mesh_10 -> quadrature order 4/8 ??? tests are OK though
